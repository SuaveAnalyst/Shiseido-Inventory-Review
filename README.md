# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The companyâ€™s main database is structured around eight relational tables, each serving a specific function in tracking inventory operations, suppliers, shipping, and transactions. A total row count of 5129 records was observed. Below is a description of each table:

- **fact_inventorytransaction:** Central fact table capturing inventory movements, order volumes, costs, and shipment data.

- **dim_product:** Describes SKUs, product types, pricing, and holding rates.

- **dim_supplier:** Contains supplier metadata including names, locations, lead times, and ordering costs.

- **dim_shipping:** Stores shipping carriers, transportation modes, and route information.

- **dim_date:** Calendar dimension table used for date-based analysis (day, month, quarter, year, etc.).

- **dim_customer:** Provides customer segmentation data for fulfillment performance.

- **dim_inspection:** Tracks inspection outcomes relevant to product quality and compliance.

- **dim_inspection:** Contains quality assurance data, specifically inspection results tied to products and suppliers, enabling analysis of defect trends, compliance rates, and supplier reliability.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
