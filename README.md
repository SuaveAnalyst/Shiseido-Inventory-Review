# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The companyâ€™s main database is structured around eight relational tables, each serving a specific function in tracking inventory operations, suppliers, shipping, and transactions. A total row count of 5129 records was observed. Below is a description of each table:

- **fact_inventorytransaction:** Central fact table capturing inventory movements, order volumes, costs, and shipment data.

- **dim_product:** Describes SKUs, product types, pricing, and holding rates.

- **dim_supplier:** Contains supplier metadata including names, locations, lead times, and ordering costs.

- **dim_shipping:** Stores shipping carriers, transportation modes, and route information.

- **dim_date:** Calendar dimension table used for date-based analysis (day, month, quarter, year, etc.).

- **dim_customer:** Provides customer segmentation data for fulfillment performance.

- **dim_inspection:** Tracks inspection outcomes relevant to product quality and compliance.

- **dim_inspection:** Contains quality assurance data, specifically inspection results tied to products and suppliers, enabling analysis of defect trends, compliance rates, and supplier reliability.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

This inventory performance review for Shiseido identifies critical inefficiencies spanning SKU management, forecasting precision, and cost containment. The analysis revealed five core patterns impacting operational performance: excess stock accumulation in underperforming SKUs driven by misaligned reorder logic, forecasting bias concentrated in specific product-region combinations, and disproportionate EOQs that hinder supplier efficiency. Additionally, a significant share of holding costs is tied to a small subset of SKUs, while several products remain in stock long after their reorder thresholds have passed. These findings inform actionable recommendations to right-size inventory, enhance forecast accuracy, and improve overall cost-to-serve across Shiseidoâ€™s supply chain.

# Insights Deep Dive
### Category 1:

* **Main insight 1.** SKUs like SKU8 and SKU49 have not sold in 7+ months yet maintain excess stock of 600+ units, highlighting dead stock risk.
  
* **Main insight 2.** Items like SKU3 and SKU97 show recent sales but remain overstocked, indicating reorder misalignment.
  
* **Main insight 3.** ROP-based alerting can help categorize SKUs into understock / on-target / overstock.

### Category 2:

* **Main insight 1.** Cosmetics in Bangalore show the highest forecast error rate (10.24%), requiring model recalibration.
  
* **Main insight 2.** Skincare has the lowest error variability across regions, indicating stable and reliable demand patterns.
  
* **Main insight 3.** Chennai has moderate errors across all product types, suggesting possible regional forecast noise.

### Category 3:

* **Main insight 1.** SKU28 (S1) has an EOQ of 409 units with only ~1000 in annual demand, suggesting batch ordering or inefficiency.
  
* **Main insight 2.** SKU44 (S2) and SKU69 (S4) reflect well-balanced EOQ-to-demand ratios, supporting lean inventory strategies.
  
* **Main insight 3.**  Suppliers contributing to over-ordering patterns can be flagged using EOQ vs Demand plots.

### Category 4:

* **Main insight 1.** The top 10 SKUs account for 80%+ of cumulative holding cost, with SKU14, SKU41, and SKU52 leading.
  
* **Main insight 2.** These SKUs show high holding cost per unit, often driven by excess stock and slow turnover.
  
* **Main insight 3.** The Pareto threshold at 80% clearly segments cost-intensive inventory for targeted actions.

### Category 5:

* **Main insight 1.** Top 10 revenue-generating SKUs vary quarterly, indicating shifting demand and possible promotional effects.
  
* **Main insight 2.** Many high-revenue SKUs overlap with forecast error or excess stock, requiring dual optimization.
  
* **Main insight 3.** Cross-matching dead stock with revenue drivers highlights missed revenue recovery opportunities.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (Missing demand or sales records for certain SKUs were assumed to represent zero demand, rather than data entry errors.)
  
* Assumption 2 (Products with no recorded transactions over time but positive stock balances were considered dead stock.)
  
* Assumption 1 (Forecast error was measured using available forecast vs. actual data without differentiating between over- and under-forecasting bias unless explicitly visualized.)
