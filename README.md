Subject: Strategic Demand Planning Analysis Initiative
Date: April 3, 2025

As part of Shiseido’s continued commitment to operational excellence and responsive supply chain management, we are requesting an analytical deep dive into five critical areas of our demand planning process. The goal is to identify risks, improve forecast accuracy, reduce inefficiencies, and ultimately support better inventory and procurement decisions across our revive store locations.

## Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Category 1:** Inventory Optimization 
- **Category 2:** Forecast Accuracy & Bias 
- **Category 3:** Supply Chain Cost Efficiency 
- **Category 4:** Cost to Serve / Holding Cost Analytics
- **Category 5:** Revenue Optimization
 

The SQL queries used to inspect and clean the data for this analysis can be found in [SQL Scripts Folder](https://github.com/SuaveAnalyst/Shiseido-Inventory-Review/tree/main/01_SQL_Scripts).

Targeted SQL queries regarding various business questions can be found here:

- **[Which SKUs are most at risk of stockouts by month?](link1)**
- **[How accurate were our forecasts vs. actual sales by product type and region?](link2)**
- **[What is the EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) for each supplier’s SKUs?](link3)**
- **[How does holding cost vary by product type?](link4)**
- **[Which SKUs show the greatest risk of capital being tied up?](link5)**


An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore sales trends can be found here [link].

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
